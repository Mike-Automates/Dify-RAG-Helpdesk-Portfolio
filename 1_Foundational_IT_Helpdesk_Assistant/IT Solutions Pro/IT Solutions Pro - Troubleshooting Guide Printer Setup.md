### Problem: I need to connect to the "ITSP-HQ-Printer" from my laptop.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1.  **Ensure Network Connection:** Your laptop must be connected to the "ITSP-Corp" Wi-Fi or wired network.

2.  **Install Printer Driver:**
    * Go to the IT Helpdesk Portal.
    * Download the appropriate driver for the **HP LaserJet Pro M404n** printer.
    * Run the installation file and follow the on-screen prompts.

3.  **Add the Printer:**
    * **Windows:** Go to **Settings > Bluetooth & devices > Printers & scanners > Add a printer or scanner**. Wait for the system to detect the printer, then click "Add device."
    * **macOS:** Go to **System Settings > Printers & Scanners** and click "Add Printer, Scanner, or Fax." The printer should appear in the list.

4.  **Verify Connectivity:** Print a test page to confirm the printer is working correctly.

5.  **Firewall/Antivirus Block:** If the printer is not being detected, your firewall or antivirus software might be blocking the connection. You may need to temporarily disable your firewall or create an exception for the printer's IP address.
